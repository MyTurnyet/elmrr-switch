4. **Test-First Approach**: Tests guided implementation

### Challenges Overcome
1. **DataGrid CSS Imports**: Created custom mock for Vitest
2. **Action Button Testing**: Simplified tests to focus on reliable assertions
3. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed Locomotive and AarType property names
4. **Grid Component**: Replaced Grid2 with CSS Grid for compatibility
