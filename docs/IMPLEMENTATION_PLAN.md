## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 Milestones
1. **Foundation Complete**: Project setup, data model, basic API
2. **Import System**: JSON data import functionality working
3. **Dashboard MVP**: Basic dashboard with navigation
4. **Car Management**: Full car management interface
5. **Industry View**: Industry status and management

### Testing Strategy
- All code files will be fully tested before moving onto writing new code files
- Unit tests for data models and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Considerations
- Development: Local development server
- Production: Static hosting (frontend) + Node.js hosting (backend)
- Database: File-based NeDB for simplicity

## Phase 2: Operations and Route Management

### Phase 2.1: Routes Management (Foundation)
Build route template system as foundation for train operations

**Goal**: Create CRUD interface for managing route templates that define ordered station sequences between yards

**Route Data Model** (already defined in types):
- ID, name, description
- originYard (Industry ID where isYard=true)
- terminationYard (Industry ID where isYard=true)
- stationSequence (ordered array of Station IDs)

#### Backend Implementation

**1. Route Model & Validation** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `backend/src/models/route.js` with Joi schema
  - Required: name, originYard, terminationYard
  - Optional: description, stationSequence (can be empty array)
  - Add _id as optional field for seed data support
  - Validation: originYard and terminationYard must reference valid yard industries
  - Validation: stationSequence items must reference valid station IDs
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests (23 tests, all passing)
- [x] Test coverage: required fields, optional fields, constraints, updates, edge cases

**2. Route API Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `backend/src/routes/routes.js` with standard CRUD operations:
  - GET /api/routes - List all routes with filtering (originYard, terminationYard, search)
  - GET /api/routes/:id - Get single route by ID
  - POST /api/routes - Create new route (with validation)
  - PUT /api/routes/:id - Update route
  - DELETE /api/routes/:id - Delete route
- [x] Register routes in `backend/src/server.js`
- [x] Add validation middleware to check:
  - Unique route names (enforced on create and update)
  - Origin/termination yards exist and are yards (isYard=true)
  - Station sequence references valid stations
- [x] Comprehensive error messages and proper HTTP status codes

**3. Backend Testing** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `backend/src/tests/routes/routes.routes.test.js` (33 tests, 598 lines)
  - Test GET all routes (8 tests: basic, filters, search, errors)
  - Test GET single route by ID (3 tests)
  - Test POST create route with valid data (10 tests: success, validation, yard checks)
  - Test POST validation failures (invalid yards, missing required fields, duplicates)
  - Test PUT update route (9 tests: success, validation, yard checks, duplicates)
  - Test DELETE route (3 tests)
  - Test duplicate route name validation
  - All 158 tests passing (125 existing + 33 new)

**4. Import/Export Support** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update `backend/src/routes/import.js` to include routes collection
  - Add routes to import sequence (Step 4: after tracks, before rolling stock)
  - Support custom _id fields for routes (preserved during import)
  - Validate route references during import:
    - Origin/termination yards must exist and be yards (isYard=true)
    - All stations in sequence must exist
    - Duplicate route names generate warnings (non-blocking)
- [x] Add routes to export functionality (routes included in GET /api/import/export)
- [x] Add routes to clear operation (POST /api/import/clear)
- [x] Added 7 comprehensive import tests (all 165 tests passing)

**5. Seed Data** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create 3 example routes in `data/seed/seed-data.json`:
  - Example 1: Vancouver to Portland Local (3 stations: seattle-wa, everett-wa, beaverton-or)
  - Example 2: Spokane-Chicago Express (direct yard-to-yard, empty stationSequence)
  - Example 3: Pacific Northwest Mainline (5 stations: everett-wa, high-bridge-wa, echo-lake-wa, spokane-wa, cascade-id)
- [x] Use human-readable _id values (vancouver-to-portland-local, spokane-chicago-express, pacific-northwest-mainline)
- [x] Validate all route references (all 6 yards and 8 stations verified to exist)
- [x] Tested import successfully: 262 records (13 stations + 29 industries + 217 cars + 3 routes)
- [x] All routes accessible via GET /api/routes with custom _id fields preserved
