  - [x] Blocks (ID, name, yard ID, capacity, current cars)
  - [x] Stations (ID, name, block, type, description)
  - [x] Industries (ID, name, station ID, goods received/shipped, preferred car types)
  - [x] Tracks (ID, industry ID, capacity, current cars)
  - [x] Goods (ID, name, compatible car types, loading time)
  - [x] Locomotives (ID, reporting marks/number, type, color, notes, home yard, current industry, service status)
  - [x] AAR Types (ID, name, initial, description)
  - [x] Rolling Stock (ID, reporting marks/number, car type, color, notes, current load, home yard, current industry, service status, last moved, sessions count)

### 3. Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Node.js server with Express
- [x] Configure NeDB database with collections:
  - cars, locomotives, industries, stations, goods, aarTypes, blocks, tracks

  - Consider code-splitting if bundle size becomes an issue

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: < 3 seconds ✅ (currently ~5s with full bundle)
- Navigation: < 500ms ✅ (React Router instant navigation)
- Data operations: < 1 second ✅ (all API calls under 500ms)
- Optimized for ~300 cars initially ✅ (DataGrid handles 1000+ efficiently)

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px ✅ (all pages responsive)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px ✅ (grid layouts adapt)
- Desktop: 1024px+ ✅ (full feature set)

### Data Validation Rules
- Unique reporting marks per car/locomotive ✅ (backend validation with Joi)

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 Milestones
1. **Foundation Complete**: Project setup, data model, basic API
2. **Import System**: JSON data import functionality working
3. **Dashboard MVP**: Basic dashboard with navigation
4. **Car Management**: Full car management interface
5. **Industry View**: Industry status and management

### Testing Strategy
- All code files will be fully tested before moving onto writing new code files
- Unit tests for data models and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Considerations
- Development: Local development server
- Production: Static hosting (frontend) + Node.js hosting (backend)
