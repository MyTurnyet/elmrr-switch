### Phase 2.2: Train Operations (Builds on Routes)

**Goal**: Implement complete train operations workflow including operating sessions, car order management, train creation with switch list generation, and session progression with rollback capability.

**Overview**: This phase builds on Phase 2.1 routes to enable realistic railroad operations. The system will track operating sessions, generate car orders based on industry demand, create trains that fulfill those orders, and produce printable switch lists for train crews.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Operating Session**: Single active session tracking current session number, with snapshot of previous session for rollback
- **Car Orders**: Industry demand for specific car types (e.g., "Lumber Mill needs 2 flatcars per session")
- **Trains**: Created with route, locomotives, and capacity; progress through Planned → In Progress → Completed → Cancelled states
- **Switch List**: Station-by-station pickup/setout instructions generated automatically based on car routing algorithm
- **Session Progression**: "Next Session" advances time, updates car statuses, deletes completed trains, generates new car orders
- **Rollback**: Restore previous session state with full car location and train restoration

#### Backend Implementation

**1. Operating Session Model & API** 
- [ ] Create `backend/src/models/operatingSession.js` with Joi schema
  - Fields: currentSessionNumber (integer, required, default: 1)
  - Fields: sessionDate (ISO date string, auto-set to current date)
  - Fields: description (optional string, max 500 chars)
  - Fields: previousSessionSnapshot (object, stores complete state for rollback)
    - Snapshot contains: sessionNumber, cars (locations), trains, carOrders
  - Validation: currentSessionNumber >= 1
  - Note: Only ONE operating session record exists (singleton pattern)
- [ ] Create `backend/src/routes/operatingSessions.js` with endpoints:
  - GET /api/sessions/current - Get current session info
  - POST /api/sessions/advance - Advance to next session (increment counter, create snapshot, update cars, delete completed trains, generate new car orders)
  - POST /api/sessions/rollback - Rollback to previous session (restore snapshot, decrement counter)
  - PUT /api/sessions/current - Update session description
- [ ] Implement session advancement logic:
  - Create snapshot of current state (session number, all car locations, all trains, all car orders)
  - Increment currentSessionNumber
  - Update all cars: increment sessionsAtCurrentLocation counter
  - Delete all trains with status "Completed"
  - Revert cars from "In Progress" or "Planned" trains to their previous locations (from snapshot)
  - Generate new car orders based on industry demand configurations
  - Update sessionDate to current date
- [ ] Implement rollback logic:
  - Validate previousSessionSnapshot exists (cannot rollback session 1)
  - Restore all car locations from snapshot
  - Restore all trains from snapshot (delete current trains, recreate previous)
  - Restore all car orders from snapshot
  - Decrement currentSessionNumber
  - Clear previousSessionSnapshot (can only rollback once)
- [ ] Add session initialization on first server start:
  - Check if operating session exists, if not create with sessionNumber: 1
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests (20+ tests)
  - Test session advancement (snapshot creation, car updates, train deletion)
  - Test rollback (state restoration, validation)
  - Test edge cases (rollback on session 1, multiple advances)

**2. Car Order Model & API**
- [ ] Create `backend/src/models/carOrder.js` with Joi schema
  - Fields: industryId (string, required, references Industry)
  - Fields: aarTypeId (string, required, references AarType)
  - Fields: sessionNumber (integer, required, session when order created)
  - Fields: status (enum: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'in-transit' | 'delivered', default: 'pending')
  - Fields: assignedCarId (string, optional, references Rolling Stock)
  - Fields: assignedTrainId (string, optional, references Train)
  - Fields: createdAt (ISO date string, auto-set)
  - Validation: industryId must exist, aarTypeId must exist
  - Support custom _id for seed data
- [ ] Create `backend/src/routes/carOrders.js` with CRUD endpoints:
  - GET /api/car-orders - List all orders with filtering (industryId, status, sessionNumber, aarTypeId)
  - GET /api/car-orders/:id - Get single order
  - POST /api/car-orders - Create new order (manual creation)
  - PUT /api/car-orders/:id - Update order (status, assigned car/train)
  - DELETE /api/car-orders/:id - Delete order
  - POST /api/car-orders/generate - Generate orders for current session based on industry demand
- [ ] Implement order generation logic:
  - Query all industries with carDemandConfig
  - For each demand config entry, check if demand should be generated this session:
    - Use formula: (currentSessionNumber % frequency) === 0
    - Example: frequency=2 means every other session (sessions 2, 4, 6...)
  - Create carOrder records with status 'pending'
  - Return count of orders generated
- [ ] Add validation middleware:
  - Prevent duplicate orders (same industry + aarType + session + status=pending)
  - Validate assigned car matches aarType when assigning
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests (25+ tests)
  - Test order generation with various frequencies
  - Test order assignment validation
  - Test filtering and status updates

**3. Industry Demand Configuration**
- [ ] Update `backend/src/models/industry.js` to add optional field:
  - carDemandConfig: array of { aarTypeId: string, carsPerSession: number, frequency: number }
  - Example: `[{ aarTypeId: "flatcar", carsPerSession: 2, frequency: 1 }, { aarTypeId: "hopper", carsPerSession: 1, frequency: 2 }]`
  - Validation: aarTypeId must reference valid AAR type, carsPerSession >= 1, frequency >= 1
  - Default: empty array (no demand)
- [ ] Update industry CRUD endpoints to support carDemandConfig field
- [ ] Update industry tests to cover demand configuration validation
- [ ] Update import/export to include carDemandConfig

**4. Train Model & API**
- [ ] Create `backend/src/models/train.js` with Joi schema
  - Fields: name (string, required, max 100 chars, unique per session)
  - Fields: routeId (string, required, references Route)
  - Fields: sessionNumber (integer, required, session when train created)
  - Fields: status (enum: 'Planned' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed' | 'Cancelled', default: 'Planned')
  - Fields: locomotiveIds (array of strings, required, min 1, references Locomotives)
  - Fields: maxCapacity (integer, required, min 1, max 100, represents max cars)
  - Fields: switchList (object, optional, generated when status changes to 'In Progress')
    - Structure: { stations: [{ stationId, stationName, pickups: [...], setouts: [...] }] }
  - Fields: assignedCarIds (array of strings, car IDs assigned to this train)
  - Fields: createdAt, updatedAt (ISO date strings)
  - Validation: routeId must exist, locomotiveIds must exist and not be assigned to other active trains
  - Support custom _id for seed data
- [ ] Create `backend/src/routes/trains.js` with CRUD endpoints:
  - GET /api/trains - List all trains with filtering (sessionNumber, status, routeId)
  - GET /api/trains/:id - Get single train with full switch list
  - POST /api/trains - Create new train (status: Planned)
  - PUT /api/trains/:id - Update train (name, locos, capacity - only if status=Planned)
  - DELETE /api/trains/:id - Delete train (only if status=Planned)
  - POST /api/trains/:id/generate-switch-list - Generate switch list (status: Planned → In Progress)
  - POST /api/trains/:id/complete - Mark train as completed (status: In Progress → Completed, update car locations)
  - POST /api/trains/:id/cancel - Cancel train (status: any → Cancelled, revert car locations if needed)
- [ ] Implement switch list generation algorithm:
  - Input: train (with route, capacity)
  - Get route with full station sequence (origin → stations → termination)
  - For each station along route:
    - Find pending car orders at industries in this station
    - Find available cars at this station matching order types
    - Assign cars to orders (up to train capacity)
    - Track pickups and setouts per station
    - Consider cars already on train for setouts at later stations
  - Additional logic:
    - Prioritize cars being routed to their home yard
    - Pick up cars even if no order exists (route to home yard or another industry)
    - Respect train capacity (current cars on train + pickups - setouts <= maxCapacity)
  - Output: switchList object with station-by-station instructions
  - Update carOrders: status pending → assigned, set assignedCarId and assignedTrainId
  - Update train: set switchList, assignedCarIds, status → In Progress
- [ ] Implement train completion logic:
  - Validate train status is "In Progress"
  - For each car in assignedCarIds, update car.currentIndustry to destination from switch list
  - Update carOrders assigned to this train: status assigned/in-transit → delivered
  - Update train status → Completed
  - Reset car.sessionsAtCurrentLocation to 0 for moved cars
- [ ] Implement train cancellation logic:
  - If status is "In Progress", revert car locations to pre-train state
  - Update carOrders: status assigned/in-transit → pending, clear assignedCarId/trainId
  - Update train status → Cancelled
- [ ] Add validation middleware:
  - Prevent locomotive assignment conflicts (loco can't be on multiple active trains)
  - Validate train name uniqueness within session
  - Prevent status changes if invalid (e.g., can't complete a Planned train)
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests (35+ tests)
  - Test train creation and validation
  - Test switch list generation algorithm with various scenarios
  - Test train completion and car movement
  - Test cancellation and rollback
  - Test locomotive assignment conflicts
