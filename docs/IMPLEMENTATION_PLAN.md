# Model Railroad Layout Tracking System - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a comprehensive Model Railroad Layout Tracking System as a Single Page Application (SPA) with mobile responsiveness.

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: Vite + React.js + TypeScript
- UI Framework: Material-UI
- Backend: Node.js + NeDB
- State Management: React Context
- Development: Incremental build starting with Phase 1

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current Focus)

### 1. Project Setup & Foundation
- [x] Create implementation plan document
- [x] Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Configure Material-UI with railroad-appropriate theming
- [x] Set up project structure with proper folder organization
- [x] Configure TypeScript strict mode and ESLint (strict mode enabled in tsconfig.app.json)

### 2. Data Model Implementation
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for all core entities:
  - [x] Blocks (ID, name, yard ID, capacity, current cars)
  - [x] Stations (ID, name, block, type, description)
  - [x] Industries (ID, name, station ID, goods received/shipped, preferred car types)
  - [x] Tracks (ID, industry ID, capacity, current cars)
  - [x] Goods (ID, name, compatible car types, loading time)
  - [x] Locomotives (ID, reporting marks/number, type, color, notes, home yard, current industry, service status)
  - [x] AAR Types (ID, name, initial, description)
  - [x] Rolling Stock (ID, reporting marks/number, car type, color, notes, current load, home yard, current industry, service status, last moved, sessions count)

### 3. Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Node.js server with Express
- [x] Configure NeDB database with collections:
  - cars, locomotives, industries, stations, goods, aarTypes, blocks, tracks
- [x] Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- [x] Add data validation middleware
- [x] Create JSON import/export functionality

### 4. Frontend Core Components
- [x] Set up React Router for SPA navigation
- [x] Implement React Context for state management
- [x] Create responsive layout with Material-UI AppBar and Drawer
- [ ] Build reusable components (DataTable, FilterPanel, etc.)

### 5. Data Import System
- [x] Create file upload interface for JSON data
- [x] Implement data validation and error reporting
- [x] Add progress indicators for import operations
- [ ] Create data preview before import confirmation

### 6. Dashboard Implementation
- [x] Landing page with layout overview
- [x] Quick stats cards (total cars, locomotives, industries)
- [x] Recent activity feed
- [x] Quick access buttons to main functions
- [x] Responsive grid layout for mobile

### 7. Car Management Interface
**Status: NOT STARTED** - Page does not exist yet (removed from App.tsx routing)
- [ ] Create CarManagement.tsx page
- [ ] List view with Material-UI DataGrid
- [ ] Advanced filtering (by car type, location, status, etc.)
- [ ] Sorting capabilities
- [ ] Car detail modal/drawer
- [ ] Manual car movement interface
- [ ] Bulk operations support

### 8. Industry View
**Status: NOT STARTED** - Page does not exist yet (removed from App.tsx routing)
- [ ] Create IndustryView.tsx page
- [ ] Industry list with current status indicators
- [ ] Goods tracking (received/needed)
- [ ] Current cars at each industry
- [ ] Manual goods update interface
- [ ] Industry detail view with track information

### 9. Navigation & UX
- [x] Clean routing between main sections
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Search functionality across entities
- [x] Mobile-optimized navigation drawer
- [x] Loading states and error handling

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: < 3 seconds
- Navigation: < 500ms
- Data operations: < 1 second
- Optimized for ~300 cars initially

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Data Validation Rules
- Unique reporting marks per car/locomotive
- Valid AAR car type assignments
- Capacity constraints on tracks/blocks
- Required fields validation

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 Milestones
1. **Foundation Complete**: Project setup, data model, basic API
2. **Import System**: JSON data import functionality working
3. **Dashboard MVP**: Basic dashboard with navigation
4. **Car Management**: Full car management interface
5. **Industry View**: Industry status and management

### Testing Strategy
- All code files will be fully tested before moving onto writing new code files
- Unit tests for data models and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Considerations
- Development: Local development server
- Production: Static hosting (frontend) + Node.js hosting (backend)
- Database: File-based NeDB for simplicity

## Future Phases (Post-Phase 1)

### Phase 2: Operations
- Switch list generation
- Train operations management
- Operating session tracking
- Route management

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Data visualization with charts
- Mobile app optimization
- Performance enhancements

## Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [x] Complete project setup with all dependencies
- [x] Working data import for existing JSON files
- [x] Responsive dashboard accessible on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Full CRUD operations for cars and industries
- [x] Clean, professional UI using Material-UI
- [ ] Performance targets met for 300+ car dataset

## Known Issues & Current Status

### Build Issues (as of current)
- TypeScript strict mode type errors need fixing:
  - Type-only imports required in AppContext.tsx (verbatimModuleSyntax enabled)
  - Error handling type issue in DataImport.tsx (catch block)
  - MuiDataGrid theme component not recognized (needs @mui/x-data-grid types)

### Missing Components
- CarManagement.tsx page (high priority - next to build)
- IndustryView.tsx page (high priority - next to build)
- Reusable components: DataTable, FilterPanel
- Utils directory with helper functions

### Backend Status
- ✅ All routes fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ All models validated with Joi schemas
- ✅ Data import functionality working
- Middleware and services directories exist but empty (not needed yet)

### Frontend Status
- ✅ Dashboard and DataImport pages complete
- ✅ Layout and navigation working
- ✅ React Context state management setup
- ❌ Car Management UI not started
- ❌ Industry View UI not started

## Notes & Considerations
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness from the start
- Use railroad-appropriate terminology and styling
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Plan for future scalability beyond 300 cars
- Maintain clean separation between frontend and backend
- Document API endpoints for future reference
