## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 Milestones
1. **Foundation Complete**: Project setup, data model, basic API
2. **Import System**: JSON data import functionality working
3. **Dashboard MVP**: Basic dashboard with navigation
4. **Car Management**: Full car management interface
5. **Industry View**: Industry status and management

### Testing Strategy
- All code files will be fully tested before moving onto writing new code files
- Unit tests for data models and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Considerations
- Development: Local development server
- Production: Static hosting (frontend) + Node.js hosting (backend)
- Database: File-based NeDB for simplicity

## Phase 2: Operations and Route Management

### Phase 2.1: Routes Management (Foundation)
Build route template system as foundation for train operations

**Goal**: Create CRUD interface for managing route templates that define ordered station sequences between yards

**Route Data Model** (already defined in types):
- ID, name, description
- originYard (Industry ID where isYard=true)
- terminationYard (Industry ID where isYard=true)
- stationSequence (ordered array of Station IDs)

#### Backend Implementation

**1. Route Model & Validation**
- [ ] Create `backend/src/models/route.js` with Joi schema
  - Required: name, originYard, terminationYard
  - Optional: description, stationSequence (can be empty array)
  - Add _id as optional field for seed data support
  - Validation: originYard and terminationYard must reference valid yard industries
  - Validation: stationSequence items must reference valid station IDs

**2. Route API Endpoints**
- [ ] Create `backend/src/routes/routes.js` with standard CRUD operations:
  - GET /api/routes - List all routes
  - GET /api/routes/:id - Get single route by ID
  - POST /api/routes - Create new route (with validation)
  - PUT /api/routes/:id - Update route
  - DELETE /api/routes/:id - Delete route
- [ ] Register routes in `backend/src/server.js`
- [ ] Add validation middleware to check:
  - Unique route names
  - Origin/termination yards exist and are yards (isYard=true)
  - Station sequence references valid stations

**3. Backend Testing**
- [ ] Create `backend/src/tests/routes/routes.routes.test.js`
  - Test GET all routes
  - Test GET single route by ID
  - Test POST create route with valid data
  - Test POST validation failures (invalid yards, missing required fields)
  - Test PUT update route
  - Test DELETE route
  - Test duplicate route name validation
  - Ensure all tests pass (maintain 100% backend test coverage)

**4. Import/Export Support**
- [ ] Update `backend/src/routes/import.js` to include routes collection
  - Add routes to import sequence (after stations, before trains)
  - Support custom _id fields for routes
  - Validate route references during import
- [ ] Add routes to export functionality

**5. Seed Data**
- [ ] Create 2-3 example routes in `data/seed/seed-data.json`:
  - Example 1: Local route (yard → 2-3 stations → yard)
  - Example 2: Direct yard-to-yard transfer (empty stationSequence)
  - Example 3: Mainline route (yard → 4+ stations → yard)
- [ ] Use human-readable _id values (e.g., "vancouver-to-portland-local")
- [ ] Validate all route references (yards and stations exist in seed data)

#### Frontend Implementation

**6. Route Context Integration**
- [ ] Update `frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`:
  - Add routes: Route[] to state
  - Add fetchRoutes() method
  - Add createRoute(data: Partial<Route>) method
  - Add updateRoute(id: string, data: Partial<Route>) method
  - Add deleteRoute(id: string) method
  - Add routes to initial data fetch in fetchData()
  - Add ADD_ROUTE, UPDATE_ROUTE, DELETE_ROUTE reducer actions

**7. Route Management UI**
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/pages/RouteManagement.tsx` (~600-800 lines):
  - DataGrid with route list (pagination: 10/25/50/100 rows)
  - Columns: Name, Description, Origin Yard, Destination Yard, # Stations, Actions
  - Actions column: View/Edit/Delete buttons per row
  - Add Route button in toolbar
  - Real-time stats summary (total routes, avg stations per route)

**8. Filtering & Search**
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering in RouteManagement:
  - Search by route name (debounced)
  - Filter by origin yard (dropdown)
  - Filter by destination yard (dropdown)
  - Filter by station count range (e.g., "Direct", "1-3 stops", "4+ stops")
  - Clear filters button
  - Use useMemo for filtered data performance

**9. Add/Edit Route Dialog**
- [ ] Create comprehensive route form dialog:
  - Text input: Route name (required, max 100 chars)
  - Text input: Description (optional, multiline)
  - Dropdown: Origin yard (required, filtered to industries where isYard=true)
  - Dropdown: Termination yard (required, filtered to industries where isYard=true)
  - Station sequence builder:
    - Available stations dropdown
    - "Add Station" button
    - Ordered list showing current sequence
    - Up/Down arrow buttons to reorder stations
    - Remove button per station
    - Empty sequence is valid (direct yard-to-yard)
  - Form validation with error messages
  - Save/Cancel buttons

**10. Route Detail View Dialog**
- [ ] Create route detail dialog (read-only):
  - Display route name and description
  - Show origin → destination with visual arrow
  - Display full station sequence with order numbers
  - Show total distance estimate (if applicable)
  - List any trains currently using this route (future: Phase 2.2)
  - Close button

**11. Delete Confirmation**
- [ ] Implement delete route confirmation dialog:
  - Warning message with route name
  - Check if route is in use by active trains (future check)
  - Confirm/Cancel buttons
  - Error handling if delete fails

**12. Navigation & Routing**
- [ ] Update `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - Add route: /routes → RouteManagement component
  - Add to navigation menu with train/route icon
  - Update active navigation highlighting

**13. Dashboard Integration**
- [ ] Update `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`:
  - Add "Total Routes" to stats cards
  - Add "Manage Routes" quick access button
  - Update stats calculation to include routes count
  - Add route-related recent activity items (route created/updated)

**14. Type Safety & Validation**
- [ ] Ensure all components use proper TypeScript types:
  - Route interface already defined in types/index.ts
  - Create RouteFormData interface if needed
  - Type-safe API calls in context methods
  - Proper error handling with typed responses

#### Testing & Quality Assurance

**15. Frontend Testing**
- [ ] Manual testing checklist:
  - Create route with all fields
  - Create direct yard-to-yard route (no stations)
  - Edit route and modify station sequence
  - Delete route with confirmation
  - Test all filters and search
  - Verify DataGrid sorting on all columns
  - Test pagination with different page sizes
  - Verify form validation (required fields, yard validation)
  - Test error handling (network errors, validation errors)
  - Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

**16. Build & Performance**
- [ ] Run frontend build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Check bundle size (should be ~1,020-1,050 KB, minimal increase)
- [ ] Run backend tests: `npm test` (all tests must pass)
- [ ] Verify DataGrid performance with 10+ routes

**17. Documentation**
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
  - Mark Phase 2.1 tasks as completed
  - Update current status and known issues
  - Document any API endpoint changes
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if needed:
  - Add routes to backend collections list
  - Document route-specific patterns or considerations
