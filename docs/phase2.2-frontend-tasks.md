## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- âœ… All Phase 2.2 backend endpoints integrated
- âœ… Session management (advance/rollback) working
- âœ… Train lifecycle (create â†’ plan â†’ execute â†’ complete) working
- âœ… Switch list generation and display working
- âœ… Car order generation and tracking working
- âœ… Industry demand configuration working

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… TypeScript compilation with no errors
- âœ… All API calls properly typed
- âœ… Error handling consistent across all pages
- âœ… Loading states prevent race conditions
- âœ… Responsive design on all screen sizes
- âœ… Performance acceptable with realistic data

### Quality Requirements
- âœ… Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- âœ… UI consistent with existing pages (Material-UI)
- âœ… User feedback for all actions (success/error messages)
- âœ… Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- âœ… Professional, railroad-appropriate terminology

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Material-UI components (already installed)
- React Router (already installed)
- Existing AppContext pattern

### Internal Dependencies
- Backend API endpoints (all complete âœ…)
- Existing type definitions
- Existing API service patterns
- Existing page layouts and components

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- TypeScript interfaces (straightforward mapping from backend)
- API service methods (follow existing patterns)
- Navigation updates (simple additions)

### Medium Risk
- AppContext integration (complex state management)
- Switch list display (complex nested data structure)
- Train operations workflow (many edge cases)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simplest page (SessionManagement) to validate integration
- Build incrementally, testing each feature before moving on
- Use existing patterns from Cars/Industries/Routes pages
- Comprehensive error handling to catch edge cases
- Manual testing with realistic scenarios

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Optimistic**: 15 hours (if everything goes smoothly)  
**Realistic**: 18-20 hours (accounting for debugging and refinement)  
**Pessimistic**: 25 hours (if significant issues arise)

**Recommended Approach**: Work in order of tasks 1-10, completing each fully before moving to the next. This ensures a solid foundation and allows for early validation of the integration.

---

## Notes

- Follow existing code patterns from CarManagement, IndustryView, and RouteManagement pages
- Use Material-UI components consistently with the rest of the app
- Maintain railroad-appropriate terminology (e.g., "switch list" not "task list")
- Consider extracting reusable components if dialogs become too large
- Keep performance in mind - use pagination for large datasets
- Test with realistic data volumes throughout development
