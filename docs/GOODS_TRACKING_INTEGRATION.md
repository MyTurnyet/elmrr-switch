## Branch Information

- **Branch**: `feature/goods-tracking-integration`
- **Base**: `main` (after merging `feature/goods-tracking-enhancement`)
- **Status**: ✅ In Progress
- **Commits**: 2

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Integrate CarDemandConfigEditor into IndustryView ✅

**Commit**: `ab4900f`

**Changes:**
- Imported `CarDemandConfigEditor` component into IndustryView
- Replaced deprecated form fields:
  - Removed: `goodsReceived` multi-select
  - Removed: `goodsToShip` multi-select
  - Removed: `preferredCarTypes` multi-select
- Updated `formData` initialization to include `carDemandConfig: []`
- Added visual divider for section separation
- Mapped goods and aarTypes data for component props
- Disabled editor during loading state

**Result:**
- Industry forms now use the new goods tracking UI
- Users can configure demand with goods, direction, and compatible car types
- Clean, intuitive interface with validation
- 73 lines removed, 11 lines added (net reduction of 62 lines)

---

### Task 2: Update Car Order Displays ✅

**Commit**: `2bd35ea`

**Changes:**
- Added "Goods / Direction" column to CarOrderManagement DataGrid
- Visual indicators with direction chips:
  - Inbound: `↓ IN` (blue/primary color)
  - Outbound: `↑ OUT` (purple/secondary color)
- Displays goods ID alongside direction indicator
- Graceful handling of missing data (shows "-")
- Compact layout with Stack and Chip components

**Result:**
- Car orders now clearly show what goods are being moved
- Direction is immediately visible with color coding
- Improved operational visibility
- 26 lines added

## Remaining Tasks

### Task 3: Test End-to-End Workflow ⏳

**Scope:**
- Create test industry with goods tracking configuration
- Generate car orders and verify goods information
- Create train and generate switch list
- Complete train and verify car loading/unloading
- Verify goods tracking throughout workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Industry can be created with carDemandConfig
- Car orders generated with correct goods/direction
- Switch list shows goods information
- Train completion updates car.currentLoad correctly
- No errors in console
- All data persists correctly

---

### Task 4: Update API Context (If Needed) ⏳

**Scope:**
- Verify goods data is fetched in AppContext
- Ensure goods are available to all components
- Add error handling for goods fetching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Goods data available in useApp hook
- Components can access goods for display
- Error states handled gracefully

---

## Technical Details

### Component Integration

**CarDemandConfigEditor Props:**
```typescript
{
  value: CarDemandConfig[];
  onChange: (config: CarDemandConfig[]) => void;
  goods: Array<{ _id: string; name: string; category?: string }>;
  aarTypes: Array<{ _id: string; code: string; name: string }>;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

**Data Mapping:**
```typescript
// Goods mapping
goods.map(g => ({ 
  _id: g.id || g._id || '', 
  name: g.name, 
  category: g.category 
}))

// AAR Types mapping
aarTypes.map(t => ({ 
  _id: t.id || t._id || '', 
  code: t.code || t.initial || '', 
  name: t.name 
}))
```

### Display Components

**Direction Indicators:**
- Inbound: `↓ IN` with `color="primary"` (blue)
- Outbound: `↑ OUT` with `color="secondary"` (purple)
- Implemented as MUI Chip components
- Minimum width of 50px for consistency

**Layout:**
- Stack component with horizontal direction
- 0.5 spacing between elements
- Typography with noWrap for long goods names
- Fallback to "-" for missing data
